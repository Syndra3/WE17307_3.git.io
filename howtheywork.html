            <p>Mix the White and Blue putty for 30 seconds and until it turns one color. After 30 seconds, roll the putty into a sausage and put it in the tray.
                Lift up your lip and put the tray straight over your mouth. After that, push the tray and putty onto your teeth. Make sure the putty covers your gum line and don't move the tray while waiting.
                Set a timer for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes is up, slowly wiggle the tray lose and off of your teeth. To avoid ruining the mold, do not pull it straight down. Make sure the gum line shows.
                Put the molds into bag and put that into a priority box and sent it back to us using the pre-paid label that came with your order.</p>
